 * A school's crest, which turns over on hover and writes "XVS" underneath it,
 * then turns back when the pointer leaves. The sidebar's mark and the sign-in
 * page's are the same object at two sizes.
 *
 * The back face is the product's wordmark, not the school's name. A school's
 * name is arbitrary text - "Holy Cross College" would set happily at this size,
 * "Government Comprehensive Secondary School, Ikeja" at no size that is still
 * readable - so a face carrying it needs a rule for shrinking and replacing it,
 * and every school past the rule is shown something that is not its name anyway.
 * Three fixed letters need no rule, and they can be drawn rather than set.
 *
 * Everything here is CSS (see `.school-mark` in index.css): the flip is a
 * transition on `transform`, and the write-on is a transition on each pen
 * stroke's dash offset. Transitions rather than keyframes on purpose - they
 * reverse from wherever they had got to, so flicking the pointer across the mark
 * never leaves it stranded mid-spin, and the letters un-write in the reverse
 * order they were written. No JS, no timers, no state.
